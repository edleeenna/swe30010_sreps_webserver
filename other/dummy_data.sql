In these people, LIPITOR is used to reduce the risk of having a heart attack or stroke. \nWhat is cholesterol?\nEveryone has cholesterol in their blood. It is a type of fat needed by the body for many things, such as building cell walls, making bile acids (which help to digest food) and some hormones. However, too much cholesterol can be a problem. Cholesterol is present in many foods and is also made in your body by the liver. If your body makes too much cholesterol or you take too much cholesterol in your diet, then your level becomes too high. High cholesterol is more likely to occur with certain diseases or if you have a family history of high cholesterol. There are different types of cholesterol. LDL is the \'bad\' cholesterol that can block your blood vessels. HDL cholesterol is the \'good\' cholesterol that is thought to remove the bad cholesterol from the blood vessels. When you have high levels of \'bad\' cholesterol in your blood, it may begin to \'stick\' to the inside of your blood vessels instead of being carried to the parts of the body where it is needed. Over time, this can form hard areas, also called plaque, on the walls of your blood vessels, making it more difficult for the blood to flow. This blocking of your blood vessels can lead to several types of blood vessel disease, heart attack, angina and stroke. There is another type of fat called triglyceride, which is a source of energy. However, high levels of triglyceride can be associated with a low level of \'good\' cholesterol and may increase your risk of heart disease. In some patients, LIPITOR is used to treat high cholesterol and high triglycerides together. How LIPITOR works\nLIPITOR belongs to a group of medicines called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. It works by reducing the amount of cholesterol made by the liver. LIPITOR reduces the \'bad\' cholesterol and raises the \'good\' cholesterol. LIPITOR also helps to protect you from a heart attack or stroke. When you are taking LIPITOR, you also need to follow a low fat diet and other measures, such as exercise and weight control. \nIn most people, there are no symptoms of abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels. Your doctor can measure your levels with a simple blood test. \nYour doctor may have prescribed LIPITOR for another reason. \nAsk your doctor if you have any questions about why LIPITOR has been prescribed for you. \nLIPITOR is not addictive. \nBefore you take LIPITOR\nWhen you must not take it\nDo not take LIPITOR if: \nyou have an allergy to atorvastatin or any of the listed at the end of this leaflet\nSymptoms of an allergic reaction may include skin rash, itching, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face. \nyou have active liver disease. \nDo not take this medicine if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. \nWomen of child-bearing age who are taking the medicine should use a proven method of birth control to avoid pregnancy. \nThe medicine may affect your unborn developing baby if you take it during pregnancy. \nDo not take the medicine if you are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed. \nThe medicine may pass into breast milk and affect your baby. \nDo not take if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering. \nDo not take if the expiry date (EXP) on the pack has passed. \nIf you take this medicine after the expiry date has passed, it may not work or it may make you unwell. \nIf you are not sure whether to start taking LIPITOR, talk to your doctor. \nBefore you start to take it\nTell your doctor if you: \nhave any other medical conditions including: \nliver problems\nmuscle pain, tenderness or weakness from other medicines used to treat cholesterol or triglycerides. \nhave a history of haemorrhagic stroke\ndrink alcohol regularly\nhave any allergies to any other medicines or any other substances, such as foods, preservatives or dyes. \nIf you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell them before you take any LIPITOR. \nTaking other medicines\nTell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines or remedies, including medicines that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop. \nSome medicines may interfere with LIPITOR. These include: \ndigoxin, a medicine used to treat some heart problems\nthe antibiotics erythromycin, clarithromycin and rifampicin\nphenytoin, a medicine used to treat epilepsy\noral contraceptives\nother medicines to treat high cholesterol or triglycerides\ncyclosporin, a medicine used to suppress the immune system\nsome medicines used to treat some fungal infections\nefavirenz and protease inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection\ndiltiazem, a medicine used to treat angina. \nThese medicines may be affected by LIPITOR, or may affect how well it works. Your doctor or pharmacist has more information on medicines to be careful with or to avoid while taking LIPITOR. How to take LIPITORHow much to take\nTake LIPITOR only when prescribed by your doctor. The usual dose of LIPITOR is between 10-80 mg taken once a day. Swallow LIPITOR with a glass of water or other liquid. Follow all given to you by your doctor and pharmacist carefully. \nThese may differ from the information contained in this leaflet. \nIf you do not understand the instructions ask your doctor or pharmacist for help. \nWhen to take it\nLIPITOR can be taken at any time of the day. However, your dose of LIPITOR should be taken at about the same time each day. \nTaking your tablet(s) at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take the tablet(s). \nLIPITOR can be taken with or without food. \nHow long to take it\nLIPITOR helps to lower your levels of cholesterol, but it does not cure your condition. Therefore, you must continue to take it as directed by your doctor if you expect to lower your cholesterol and keep it down. You may have to take cholesterol-lowering medicine for the rest of your life. If you stop taking LIPITOR, your cholesterol levels may rise again. If you forget to take it\nIf it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to. Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking your tablet(s) as you would normally. \nIf you are not sure whether to skip the dose, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \nDo not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed. \nIf you have trouble remembering to take your tablets, ask your pharmacist for some hints. \nIf you take too much (overdose) \nImmediately telephone the Australian Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26), or the New Zealand National Poisons Information Centre (telephone 0800 POISON or 0800 764 766), or go to the Accident and Emergency department at your nearest hospital if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much LIPITOR. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. \nYou may need urgent medical attention. Keep telephone numbers of these facilities handy. \nWhile you are using LIPITOR\nThings you must do\nHave your cholesterol and triglyceride levels checked when your doctor says, to make sure that LIPITOR is working. \nIf you become pregnant while you are taking LIPITOR, stop taking it and contact your doctor immediately. \nTell your doctor or pharmacist that you are taking LIPITOR if you are about to start on any new medicine. \nThings you must not do\nDo not give LIPITOR to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you. \nDo not use LIPITOR to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to. \nThings to be careful of\nAvoid drinking large quantities of alcohol. \nDrinking large quantities of alcohol may increase your chance of LIPITOR causing liver problems. \nAvoid drinking large quantities of grapefruit juice. \nGrapefruit juice contains one or more components that alter the metabolism of some medicines, including LIPITOR. \nDrinking very large quantities (over 1.2 litres) of grapefruit juice each day increases your chance of LIPITOR causing side effects. \nBe careful driving or operating machinery until you know how LIPITOR affects you. \nLIPITOR generally does not cause any problems with your ability to drive a car or operate machinery. However, as with many other medicines, LIPITOR may cause dizziness in some people. \nSide effects\nTell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking LIPITOR. \nAll medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects. \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have. \nTell your doctor if you notice any of the following and they worry you: \nconstipation, diarrhoea\nunusual tiredness or weakness\nstomach or belly pain, nausea\nheadache\ntrouble sleeping. \nThese are the more common side effects, and are usually mild and short-lived. Tell your doctor immediately or go to the casualty department of your nearest hospital if you notice any of the following: \nswelling of the face, lips, mouth throat or neck which may cause difficulty in swallowing and breathing\nunexpected muscle pain, tenderness or weakness not caused by exercise\ntingling in the hands or feet\nrash, itching. \nThese may be serious side effects requiring urgent medical attention. Serious side effects are rare. Other side effects not listed above may also occur in some patients. Tell your doctor if you notice anything else that is making you feel unwell. \nDo not be alarmed by the list of possible side effects. You may not experience any of them. \nStorage\nKeep your tablets in the blister pack until it is time to take them. \nIf you take the tablets out of the blister pack they may not keep well. \nKeep LIPITOR in a cool dry place where the temperature stays below 25 degrees C. Do not store LIPITOR or any other medicine in the bathroom or near a sink. Do not leave your tablets in the car or on windowsills. \nHeat and dampness can destroy some medicines. \nKeep your tablets where young children cannot reach them. \nA locked cupboard at least one and a half metres off the ground is a good place to store medicines. \nDisposal\nIf your doctor tells you to stop taking LIPITOR, or the tablets have passed their expiry date, ask your pharmacist what to do with any tablets that are left over. \nFurther information\nLIPITOR comes in blister packets of 30 tablets. \nThe active ingredient of LIPITOR is atorvastatin.

This pressure helps your blood move around your body. Your blood pressure may be different at different times of the day, depending on how busy or worried you are. You have hypertension when your blood pressure stays higher than normal, even when you are calm or relaxed.There are usually no signs of hypertension. The only way of knowing that you have hypertension is to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. You may feel fine and have no symptoms, but if high blood pressure is not treated, it can lead to serious health problems (such as heart disease).Micardis helps to lower your blood pressure but does not cure hypertension. Micardis contains telmisartan. Telmisartan belongs to a group of medicines called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. It works by widening the blood vessels of the body, and therefore helping to lower your blood pressure.Micardis may be used either alone or in combination with other medicines used to treat high blood pressure.Micardis may have been prescribed for you for another reason.Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why Micardis has been prescribed for you.2.

You may need to read it again.\nWhat Pariet is used for\nThe name of your medicine is Pariet. It contains the active ingredient rabeprazole sodium. \nReflux Oesophagitis:\nPariet is used to treat reflux oesophagitis or reflux disease. This can be caused by food and acid from the stomach flowing the wrong way (reflux) back up the food pipe, also known as the oesophagus.\nReflux can cause a burning sensation in the chest rising up to the throat, also known as heartburn.\nPeptic Ulcers:\nPariet is used to treat peptic ulcers. Depending on the position of the ulcer it is called a gastric or duodenal ulcer. A gastric ulcer occurs in the stomach. A duodenal ulcer occurs in the duodenum which is the tube leading out of the stomach.\nThese ulcers can be caused by too much acid being made in the stomach. \nMost people who have a peptic ulcer also have a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori in their stomach. Your doctor may also prescribe a course of antibiotics (clarithromycin and amoxycillin) for you. When Pariet is taken with antibiotics, the combination therapy will kill the Helicobacter pylori and let your ulcer heal.\nChronic Gastritis:\nThe presence of the bacteria Helicobacter pylori may cause the stomach to become inflamed, resulting in pain, nausea and vomiting.\nWhen Pariet tablets are taken with antibiotics, they will help kill Helicobacter pylori and allow the stomach to heal.\nHow Pariet works\nPariet belongs to a group of medicines called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Pariet works by decreasing the amount of acid the stomach makes, to give relief from the symptoms and allow healing to take place. Your food will still be digested in the normal way.\nYour doctor may have prescribed Pariet for another reason. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why Pariet has been prescribed for you.\nPariet is only available with a doctor\'s prescription.\nBefore you take Pariet\nWhen you must not take it:\nDo not take Pariet if you have an allergy to:\n* rabeprazole sodium\n* any of the listed at the end of this leaflet. \n* other proton pump inhibitors.\nSymptoms of an allergic reaction may include:\n* rash, itching or hives on the skin\n* shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing\n* swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body\nDo not take Pariet if:\n* you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or you are breast-feeding.\n* the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.\n* the expiry date (month and year) printed on the pack has passed.

A duodenal ulcer occurs in the duodenum which is the tube leading out from the stomach. If you have a peptic ulcer, your doctor will prescribe Nexium with antibiotics. When Nexium and antibiotics are taken together, they work to kill the bacterium and let your ulcer heal. You may need further treatment with antibiotics.Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome\nNexium is also used to treat a rare condition called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, where the stomach produces large amounts of acid, much more than in ulcers or reflux disease.How Nexium works\nNexium is a type of medicine called a proton-pump inhibitor. It works by decreasing the amount of acid made by the stomach, to give relief of symptoms and allow healing to take place. This does not stop food being digested in the normal way.Follow all given to you by your doctor carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet. \nAsk your doctor if you want more information. Your doctor may have prescribed Nexium for another reason. \nThere is no evidence that Nexium is addictive. \nBefore you take Nexium\nWhen you must not take it\nDo not take Nexium if you have allergies to:\nesomeprazole or any ingredient listed at the end of this leaflet. \nany medicines containing a proton-pump inhibitor.\nSome of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing; swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body; rash, itching or hives on the skin. Nexium is not approved for use in children younger than 12 years of age.There is no specific information about use in children younger than 12 years of age, so Nexium is not recommended in these patients.Do not take Nexium after the use by (expiry) date printed on the pack. It may have no effect at all, or worse, an entirely unexpected effect if you take it after the expiry date.\nDo not take Nexium if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering. \nBefore you start to take it\nYou must tell your doctor if you have:\nallergies to any other medicines, foods, dyes or preservatives. \nany problems with your liver\nany other medical conditions\nDo not take Nexium if you are pregnant or breastfeeding unless your doctor says so.

You may need different amounts of your medicine or you may need to take different medicines. Your doctor can tell you what to do if you are taking any other medicines.Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking Nexium.If you have not told your doctor about any of these things, tell them before you take Nexium.\nHow to take Nexium\nFollow all given to you by your doctor and pharmacist carefully. These instructions may differ from the information contained in this leaflet\nIf you do not understand the on the label, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help. \nHow to take it\nTake one Nexium each day, unless your doctor has told you otherwise. The dose of Nexium is usually 20 mg or 40 mg a day depending on what condition you are being treated for and how severe it is.\nSwallow Nexium whole with a glass of water. Do not crush or chew the tablets. If the tablets are chewed or crushed they will not work properly.\nIf you have difficulty swallowing the tablets:\n 1. Place the tablet in half a glass of non-carbonated water. Mineral water or other liquids are not suitable\n 2. Gently mix the tablet and water by stirring, taking care not to crush the tablet\n 3. Stir until the tablet dissolves into little pellets\n 4. Drink the liquid with the pellets immediately, or within 30 minutes. Do not chew the pellets\n 5. Rinse the glass with half a glass of water and drink. \nIf you cannot swallow at all, follow steps 1-3 above to disperse the tablets and administer the liquid and pellets through a gastric tube.\nTake Nexium at about the same time each day. Keeping a regular time for taking Nexium will help to remind you to take it. \nIn most patients, Nexium relieves symptoms rapidly and healing is usually complete within 4 weeks. Continue taking Nexium for as long as your doctor tells you. \nNexium can be taken with food or on an empty stomach.\nIf you forget to take it\nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking it as you would normally. \nIf it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to. \nDo not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed. \nIf you have trouble remembering when to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints. \nTaking too much (overdose) \nTelephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (13 11 26) or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital immediately if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too many Nexium even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.\nWhile you are taking NEXIUM\nThings you must do\nTake Nexium exactly as your doctor has prescribed. \nIf you are about to be started on any new medicine, tell your doctor, dentist or pharmacist that you are taking Nexium. \nTell all doctors, dentists and pharmacists who are treating you that you are taking Nexium. \nTell your doctor if you become pregnant while you are taking Nexium. \nTell your doctor if your symptoms return. Although Nexium can heal ulcers successfully, it may not prevent them recurring at a later date.\nThings you must not do\nDo not take it to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.\nDo not give this medicine to anyone else, even if their symptoms seem similar to yours.\nSide effects\nTell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking Nexium. Nexium helps most people with peptic ulcers or reflux disease, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people.\nAll medicines can have side effects.\nSometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects. \nAsk your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have. \nTell your doctor if you notice any of the following and they worry you: \nnausea or vomiting\nconstipation\ndiarrhoea\nheadache\nwind\nstomach pain\nskin rash \nitchy skin\ndizziness\ndry mouth. \nThese are side effects are usually mild.

These side effects are rare.\nTell your doctor if you think you have any of these effects or notice anything else that is making you feel unwell.

It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.\nAll medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of taking COVERSYL against the benefits they expect it will have for you. \nIf you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again. \nWhat COVERSYL is\nThe name of your medicine is COVERSYL. The medicine contains the active ingredient perindopril arginine. Perindopril belongs to a group of medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.\nWhat COVERSYL is used for\nCOVERSYL is available only with a doctor\'s prescription. \nCOVERSYL lowers high blood pressure, a condition which doctors call hypertension. \nEveryone has blood pressure. This pressure helps get your blood all around the body. Your blood pressure may be different at different times of the day, depending on how busy or worried you are. You have high blood pressure when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm or relaxed. \nThere are usually no symptoms of high blood pressure. The only way of knowing that you have it is to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. If high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to serious health problems. You may feel fine and have no symptoms, but eventually it can cause stroke, heart disease and kidney failure. COVERSYL helps lower your blood pressure. \nYou may be prescribed COVERSYL for heart failure. Heart failure means that the heart muscle cannot pump blood strongly enough to supply all the blood needed throughout the body. Heart failure is not the same as heart attack and does not mean that the heart stops working.\nSome people develop heart failure after having had a heart attack. However there are also other causes of heart failure. \nHeart failure may start off with no symptoms, but as the condition progresses, you may feel short of breath or may get tired easily after light physical activity such as walking. You may wake up short of breath at night. Fluid may collect in different parts of the body, often first noticed as swollen ankles and feet. In severe heart failure, symptoms may occur even at rest. \nCOVERSYL helps to treat heart failure. If you follow your doctor\'s advice, your ability to perform daily activities may improve. You may breath more easily, feel less tired, and have less swelling. \nYou may also have been prescribed COVERSYL if you have coronary artery disease. Coronary artery disease is narrowing of the vessels carrying blood to the heart. In patients with coronary artery disease, COVERSYL has been shown to reduce some of the risks, including heart attacks. \nBEFORE YOU TAKE COVERSYL\nThere are some people who shouldn\'t take COVERSYL. Please read the list below. If you think any of these situations apply to you or you have any questions, please consult your doctor. \nDo not take COVERSYL if:\nyou are allergic to perindopril or any of the listed at the end of this leaflet\nyou are pregnant or trying to become pregnant\nyou are breastfeeding or plan to breast-feed\nyou undergo renal dialysis using polyacrylonitrile membranes\nyou have renal artery stenosis (a problem with the blood vessels to one or both kidneys) \nyou have experienced swelling of the face, tongue, lips or throat either spontaneously or in response to another medicine in the past. (This rare condition is known as angio-oedema) \nthe packaging is torn or shows sign of tampering\nthe expiry date (EXP) on the pack has passed. \nTell your doctor straight away if: \nYou become pregnant while you are taking COVERSYL\nYou are undergoing desensitisation treatment, or have had an allergic reaction during previous desensitisation treatment (e.g. treatments using bee, wasp or ant venom). \nYou are undergoing, or have had an allergic reaction during previous, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis, a technique where LDL is \'filtered\' out of a patient\'s blood, using dextran sulphate. \nIf you are to undergo anaesthesia and/or surgery\nif you have recently suffered from diarrhoea or vomiting, \nYou have any other health problems, including:\n- Kidney disease\n- Liver disease\n- High or low levels of potassium, or other problems with salt balance\n- Diabetes\n- Heart disease\nCOVERSYL can generally be used safely by elderly people. However reduced kidney function is often found in elderly people and in this case, the starting dose should always be 2.5mg. COVERSYL is not recommended for children. \nIf you think any of these situations apply to you, or you have any doubts or questions about taking COVERSYL consult your doctor or pharmacist. \nTaking other medicines\nTaking COVERSYL may change the effect of some medicines, and some medicines may affect how well COVERSYL works. You may need different amounts of your medication or to take different medicines. The medicines that may interact with COVERSYL include the following: \nSome antibiotic drugs\nSome anti-inflammatory drugs\nLithium medications (used to treat mood swings and some types of depression) \nPotassium-sparing diuretics, sources of potassium, like potassium tablet and salt substitutes containing potassium. \nSome medications used to treat high blood pressure (including diuretics (sometimes called "fluid" or "water" tablets because they increase the amount of urine passed each day), a fast or irregular heartbeat, and other heart conditions\nMedicines used to treat diabetes (tablets and insulin). \nIt is a good idea to remind your doctor of all other medicines you take. Your doctor or pharmacist has more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking COVERSYL. \nHOW TO TAKE COVERSYL\nThe dose of COVERSYL you may need each day will be decided and adjusted by your doctor. This will normally be 2.5mg (COVERSYL 2.5MG), 5mg (COVERSYL 5MG) or 10mg (COVERSYL 10MG) once daily for high blood pressure and for people with coronary artery disease or 2.5mg (COVERSYL 2.5MG) to 5mg (COVERSYL 5MG) once daily for heart failure. \nSwallow your tablet(s) with a glass of water, preferably in the morning before a meal. \nIf you forget to take it\nIf it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to. Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking it as you would normally. \nDo not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed. \nHow long to take it\nCOVERSYL helps control your blood pressure, or heart failure or coronary artery disease but does not cure it. Continue taking the tablets for as long as your doctor tells you. \nIf you take too much\nImmediately telephone your doctor, or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26 in Australia) if you think you or anyone else may have taken too much COVERSYL. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.\nWHILE YOU ARE TAKING COVERSYL\nThings you must not do\nDo not give COVERSYL to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you. \nDo not use COVERSYL to treat other complaints unless your doctor tells you to. \nDo not stop taking COVERSYL or change the dosage, without checking with your doctor. \nDo not stop taking your tablets because you are feeling better, unless advised by your doctor. \nSIDE EFFECTS\nCOVERSYL helps most people with high blood pressure, heart failure or coronary artery disease, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people. All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. \nWith COVERSYL, the side effects can include: \ncough, often described as dry and irritating\nheadache, dizziness, vertigo, paraesthesia\ntinitus, vision disturbances\nhypotension\nfeeling tired or lethargic\nnausea or stomach pain\nmuscle cramps\nrash, pruritus\nThese side effects when they occur are usually mild. \nConsult your doctor or pharmacist if you experience any of these or notice anything else that is making you feel unwell. \nDo not be alarmed by this list of possible side effects. You may not experience any of them. Other uncommon side effects have been reported and you should ask your doctor or pharmacist if you want to know more. \nIf any of the signs below occur then tell your doctor immediately or go to the Accident and Emergency department at your nearest hospital:\nSwelling of your lips, face, mouth, tongue or throat. \nA fast and irregular heart beat. \nDifficulty in breathing\nSevere blisters, skin rash, itching or other allergic reactions. \nThese side effects are extremely rare but can become serious. \nAFTER TAKING COVERSYL\nStorage\nHeat and dampness can destroy some medicines.

It does not contain all the information that is known about CRESTOR.It does not take the place of talking to your doctor and pharmacist.All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor will have weighed the risks of you taking CRESTOR against the benefits they expect it will have for you.If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\nKeep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.\nWhat CRESTOR is for\nEveryone has cholesterol and triglycerides in their blood. They are fatty substances needed by the body for many things.Triglycerides are an energy source for the body. Cholesterol is used for such things as building cells, making bile acids (which help to digest foods) and making some hormones.There are different types of cholesterol. Too much of the "bad" cholesterol (LDL) can block the blood vessels that supply your heart and brain with blood, and can cause heart attack, angina and stroke. The "good" cholesterol (HDL) helps to remove the bad cholesterol from the blood vessels. High levels of triglycerides can be associated with a low level of "good" cholesterol and may increase the risk of heart disease.CRESTOR belongs to a group of medicines known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (also known as \'statins\'). It lowers the "bad" cholesterol, and raises the "good" cholesterol when exercise and changes to diet are not enough on their own.Cholesterol is present in many foods and is also made by your body. CRESTOR does not reduce the cholesterol that comes from fat in food. Because of this, when you are taking CRESTOR, you need to follow a low-fat diet, control your weight and exercise regularly.High cholesterol is also more likely to occur with certain diseases or if you have a family history of high cholesterol.Your doctor will have explained why you are being treated with CRESTOR and told you what dose to take. Your doctor may need to check your cholesterol levels before prescribing CRESTOR or changing your dose.Follow all given to you by your doctor carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.\nYour doctor may prescribe this medicine for another use. Ask your doctor if you want more information.\nCRESTOR is not addictive.\nCRESTOR is not recommended for use in children as its effects in children have not been established.\nBefore you use CRESTOR\nWhen you must not use it\nDo not use CRESTOR if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant.

CRESTOR can be taken 2 hours before or 2 hours after taking an antacid\nwarfarin (e.g. COUMADIN and MAREVAN, used to stop blood clots)\ngemfibrozil (e.g. LOPID, JEZIL, and AUSGEM, used to lower blood lipids)\nLopinavir/ritonavir combination (KALETRA) used to treat HIV infection\nmedicines that you buy at the chemist, supermarket or health food shop, including herbal medicines.\nYour doctor will consider if CRESTOR should be used together with any of these medicines, or may wish to adjust the dose of CRESTOR or the other medicines. These medicines may affect the way CRESTOR works.Your doctor or pharmacist can tell you what to do if you are taking any of these medicines.If you have not told your doctor about any of these things, tell them before you take CRESTOR.\nEffects on driving and using machinery\nBe careful driving a car or operating machinery until you know if CRESTOR affects you.

Depending on your condition and ethnic background, your doctor will decide the most appropriate starting dose for you.Your doctor will monitor your cholesterol and triglyceride levels during your treatment, and, if needed, may increase your CRESTOR dose to 20 mg once daily. For most patients a maximum 20 mg CRESTOR daily dose is sufficient to treat their condition.A small number of patients may need to further increase their CRESTOR dose to 40 mg once daily, for example patients whose high cholesterol is hereditary. Your doctor will advise you on the dose that\'s right for your condition. The daily dose of CRESTOR must not exceed 40 mg daily.DO NOT INCREASE OR ADJUST YOUR CRESTOR DOSE YOURSELF.\nTake CRESTOR once a day, at about the same time each day.

It does not contain all of the available information.\nIt does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.\nAll medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the expected benefits of you taking Avodart against the risks this medicine could have for you.\nIf you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\nKeep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.\nWhat is Avodart used for?\nAvodart (dutasteride) belongs to a group of medicines called 5 alpha reductase enzyme inhibitors which are used in men who have a condition known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).\nBPH is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland which is located at the lower portion of the urinary bladder surrounding the urethra (urine carrying tube). In men with BPH, the prostate gland becomes large enough to squeeze the urine tube running through it. If the urine tube is squeezed it narrows, making it more difficult for you to pass urine normally and you may have some or all of the following symptoms:\ndifficulty in starting to urinate\nan interrupted, weak urinary stream\nmore frequent urination, especially at night\nfeeling that you need to urinate right away\nleaking or dribbling\na feeling that you cannot empty your bladder completely\nAs the disease progresses, untreated BPH can lead to an increased risk of complete blockage of urine flow (acute urinary retention) and/or the need for surgery.\nProstate growth is caused by a hormone in the blood called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Avodart lowers DHT production in the body, leading to shrinkage of the enlarged prostate in most men. Just as your prostate became large over a long period of time, reducing the size of your prostate and improving your symptoms may take time.\nAvodart capsules contain the active ingredient dutasteride dissolved in a liquid.\nYour doctor may have prescribed Avodart for another reason. Ask your doctor if you are unsure why Avodart was prescribed for you.\nAvodart is not addictive.\nBefore you take Avodart\nDo not take if:\nYou must not take Avodart if:\nyou have ever had an allergic reaction to dutasteride, other 5 alpha reductase enzymeinhibitors or any of the listed toward the end of this leaflet.

If dutasteride is absorbed through the skin by a woman who is pregnant with a male baby, it may cause the male baby to be born with abnormalities of the genital organs.\nHow do I take Avodart?\nHow much to take\nTake Avodart as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.\nThe usual dose in men is one capsule daily.\nHow to take it\nTake Avodart with or without food. Each capsule must be swallowed whole and not chewed or opened. Contact with the contents of the capsule may make your mouth or throat sore.\nHow long to take it for\nIt is important to continue to take Avodart for as long as your doctor prescribes it, even if you do not feel any immediate benefit. Some men notice an early improvement in their symptoms, however others may need to continue for 3-6 months to see if Avodart helps them. You must also continue to take your medicine as your symptoms improve.\nDo not stop taking Avodart, or change the dose without first checking with your doctor.\nWhat do I do if I take too much? (Overdose)\nImmediately telephone your doctor or Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26) for advice, if you think you or anyone else may have taken too much Avodart, even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.\nIf you are not sure what to do, contact your doctor or pharmacist.\nWhile you are taking Avodart\nThings you must do\nTell your doctor if, for any reason, you have not taken your medicine exactly as directed.\nIf you forget to take a capsule, don\'t worry, just take the next dose as normal and continue as before.\nDo not take a double dose to make up for the one you have missed.\nAvodart decreases your PSA (prostate-specific antigen) levels. Therefore, if you are having a blood test to measure your PSA levels, tell your doctor you are taking Avodart.\nThings you must not do\nDo not give this medicine toanyone else, even if their symptoms seem similar to yours.\nDo not use Avodart to treat any other complaints unless your doctor says to.\nThings to be careful of\nBe careful driving or operating machinery until you know how Avodart affects you.\nAvodart generally does not cause any problems with your ability to drive a car or operate machinery.\nWhat are the side effects?\nCheck with your doctor as soon as possible if you think you are experiencing any side effects or allergic reactions due to taking Avodart, even if the problem is not listed below.

ZANIDIP belongs to a group of medicines called calcium channel blockers (of the dihydropyridine group).ZANIDIP lowers high blood pressure, which doctors call hypertension. It works by relaxing some of the blood vessels in the body and reducing resistance to the flow of blood through the blood vessels.Everyone has blood pressure. This pressure helps get your blood all around your body. Your blood pressure may be different at different times of the day, depending on how busy or worried you are. You have hypertension (high blood pressure) when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm and relaxed.There are usually no symptoms of hypertension. The only way of knowing that you have hypertension is to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. If high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to serious health problems. You may feel fine and have no symptoms, but eventually hypertension can cause stroke, heart disease and kidney failure. ZANIDIP helps lower your blood pressure.ZANIDIP cannot be obtained without a doctor\'s prescription.There is no evidence that ZANIDIP is addictive.Before you take ZANIDIPWhen you must not take it\nDo not take ZANIDIP if you have an allergy to:\nlercanidipine or any of the listed at the end of this leaflet\nany drugs closely related to lercanidipine (such as amlodipine, felodipine or nifedipine)\nDo not take ZANIDIP if you:\nhave severe liver or kidney disease\nare also taking another medicine called cyclosporin\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.Do not take ZANIDIP if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant.\nLike most calcium channel blockers, ZANIDIP is not recommended for use during pregnancy. Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while you are taking ZANIDIP.\nDo not take ZANIDIP if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. Like most calcium channel blockers ZANIDIP is not recommended while you are breast-feeding.\nDo not take ZANIDIP if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.\nDo not take ZANIDIP if the tablets show visible sign of deterioration (for example, are broken or discoloured).\nDo not take ZANIDIP if the expiry date (EXP) printed on the pack has passed. If you take this medicine after the expiry date has passed, it may not work (as well).\nIf you are not sure whether you should start taking ZANIDIP, talk to your doctor.\nDo not give ZANIDIP to a child under the age of 18 years. ZANIDIP is not recommended for use in children.\nBefore you start to take it\nYou must tell your doctor:\n 1. if you are allergic to any other medicine or any foods, dyes or preservatives.\n 2. if you are taking other drugs for high blood pressure, such as beta-blockers, diuretics, ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists.\n 3. if you have or have ever had any other health problems/medical conditions, including:\nliver or kidney disease or are on dialysis\ncertain other heart conditions such as: uncontrolled heart failure, an obstruction to flow of blood from the heart, unstable angina (chest pain or tightness at rest or progressively increasing) or you have had a heart attack one month ago or less and / or if you require a pacemaker\nIf you have not told your doctor about any of the above or if you are not sure, tell them before you take ZANIDIP.\nTaking other medicines\nTell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, including medicines that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop. Some medicines may interfere with the way ZANIDIP works, or may be affected by ZANIDIP. These include:\nritonavir, cyclosporin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, fluoxetine, cimetidine (more than 800 mg daily).\nYou may need different amounts of your medicine, or you may need to take different medicines. Your doctor or pharmacist can tell you what to do if you are taking any of these medicines.Also ask your doctor or pharmacist what to do if you are taking, or are about to take the following medicines: phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, amiodarone, quinidine, digoxin, simvastatin, metoprolol or propranolol.If you have not told your doctor about any of the medicines listed above, tell them before you start taking ZANIDIP.How to take ZANIDIPHow much to take\nFollow all given to you by your doctor carefully. These may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.\nThe usual dose is one 10 mg tablet taken once daily, but may be increased to 20 mg once daily.\nIf you do not understand the instructions on the box, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.\nHow to take it\nSwallow ZANIDIP whole with a glass of water.\nWhen to take it\nTake ZANIDIP at about the same time each day, at least 15 minutes before a meal. ZANIDIP will have the best effect if it is taken at the same time each day at least 15 minutes before meals. This will also help you remember when to take the tablets.\nHow long to take it\nZANIDIP helps control your condition, but does not cure it. Therefore you must take ZANIDIP every day. Continue taking the tablets for as long as your doctor tells you to.If you forget to take it\nIf you forget to take a dose but remember within 12 hours from when the dose was due, take it straight away, then continue as normal the next day. Otherwise skip that day\'s dose but be sure to take the next day\'s dose when it is due. If you are not sure about what to do, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\nDo not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed. If you have trouble remembering to take your tablets, ask your pharmacist for some hints.\nIf you have missed several doses, consult your doctor.\nIf you take too much (overdose)\nImmediately telephone your doctor or Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26), or go to Accident & Emergency at your nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much ZANIDIP. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. You may need urgent medical attention. Keep telephone numbers of these places/services handy.\nIf you take too much ZANIDIP it may cause your blood pressure to become too low and you may feel your heart beats become irregular and faster. It may also lead to unconsciousness.\nWhile you are using ZANIDIP\nThings you must do\nUse ZANIDIP exactly as your doctor has prescribed. If you do not follow your doctor\'s instructions correctly, your blood pressure may not be controlled.\nBe sure to keep all of your doctor\'s appointments so that your progress can be checked.\nIf you become pregnant while you are taking ZANIDIP, tell your doctor.\nIf you are about to start taking any new medicine, tell your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking ZANIDIP.\nTell all other doctors, dentists and pharmacists who are treating you that you are taking ZANIDIP.\nIf you have an operation, tell the anaesthetist that you are taking this medicine.\nThings you must not do\nDo not give ZANIDIP to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.\nDo not use ZANIDIP to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.\nThings to be careful of\nBe careful driving or operating machinery until you know how ZANIDIP affects you.

You may need to read it again.\nWHAT CITALOPRAM SANDOZ IS USED FOR\nThis medicine is used for the treatment of depression.\nIt contains the active ingredient citalopram hydrobromide. Citalopram hydrobromide belongs to a group of medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).\nThey are thought to work by their actions on brain chemicals called amines which are involved in controlling mood.\nDepression is longer lasting or more severe than the “low moods” everyone has from time to time due to the stress of everyday life. It is thought to be caused by a chemical imbalance in parts of the brain. This imbalance affects your whole body and can cause emotional and physical symptoms such as feeling low in spirit, loss of interest in activities, being unable to enjoy life, poor appetite or overeating, disturbed sleep, often waking up early, loss of sexual drive, lack of energy and feeling guilty over nothing.\nCitalopram Sandoz corrects this chemical imbalance and may help relieve the symptoms of depression.\nAsk your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you.\nYour doctor may have prescribed it for another reason.\nThis medicine is available only with a doctor’s prescription.\nCitalopram Sandoz is not addictive.

Your doctor will know when it is safe to start Citalopram Sandoz after the MAOI has been stopped.\nDo not take this medicine after the expiry date printed on the pack or if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.\nIf it has expired or is damaged, return it to your pharmacist for disposal.\nIf you are not sure whether you should start taking this medicine, talk to your doctor.\nBefore you start to take it\nTell your doctor if you have allergies to any other medicines, foods, preservatives or dyes.\nDo not take this medicine if you have or have had any of the following medical conditions:\nbleeding disorder\ndiabetes\nheart disease\nkidney disease\nliver disease\nbipolar disorder (manic depression)\na history of seizures or fits\nrestlessness and/or a need to move often.\nTell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breastfeeding.

Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking Ramipril Sandoz against the benefits they expect it will have for you.\nIf you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\nKeep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.\nWhat Ramipril Sandoz is used for\nRamipril Sandoz belongs to a group of medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.\nRamipril Sandoz is used to treat:\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension)\nsome heart conditions such as heart failure after a heart attack\nkidney problems in some patients\nRamipril Sandoz is also used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems and complications in patients aged 55 years or more with heart or blood vessel disease, or diabetes.\nHypertension\nRamipril Sandoz is used to lower high blood pressure (hypertension). Everyone has blood pressure. This pressure helps get your blood all around your body. Your blood pressure may be different at different times of the day and can be influenced by how busy or worried you are. You have hypertension when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm and relaxed.\nThere are usually no symptoms of hypertension. The only way of knowing that you have hypertension is to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. If high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to serious health problems, including stroke, heart disease and kidney failure.\nHeart Failure after a Heart Attack\nRamipril Sandoz may be used after a heart attack. A heart attack occurs when one of the major blood vessels supplying blood to your heart becomes blocked. This means that your heart muscle cannot receive the oxygen it needs and becomes damaged. This may lead to further problems, such as heart failure, irregular heart rhythms and blood clots.\nHeart failure means that the heart muscle is weak and cannot pump blood strongly enough to supply all the blood needed throughout the body. Heart failure is not the same as heart attack and does not mean that the heart stops. Heart failure may start off with no symptoms, but as the condition progresses, patients may feel short of breath or may get tired easily after light physical activity such as walking. Some patients may wake up short of breath at night. Fluid may collect in different parts of the body, often first noticed as swollen ankles and feet.\nKidney Problems\nRamipril Sandoz may be used to treat some kidney problems. Some conditions such as diabetes and hypertension can lead to kidney problems. These problems develop slowly over several years. Good control of your blood sugar and blood pressure are important in keeping your kidneys healthy, but may not always prevent kidney damage from occurring.\nPrevention of Cardiovascular Problems and Complications\nRamipril Sandoz may be used to reduce the risk of some of the problems and complications that may arise in patients aged 55 or more who have problems such as coronary artery disease (heart disease caused by poor blood flow in the blood vessels of the heart), peripheral vascular disease (poor circulation in the hands or feet), or stroke.\nRamipril Sandoz may also be used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems and complications in patients with diabetes aged 55 years or more who may be considered at risk because of one or more additional factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, kidney problems, a current smoker, or previous disease of the blood vessels.\nHow Ramipril Sandoz works \nRamipril Sandoz works by widening the blood vessels, which reduces the pressure in the vessels, making it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body. This helps increase the supply of oxygen to your heart, so that when you place extra demands on your heart, such as during exercise, your heart may cope better and you may not get short of breath as easily.\nBy increasing the supply of oxygen to your heart, your heart does not have to work as hard and it is under less stress, which may reduce the risk of further damage occurring to it following a heart attack.\nRamipril Sandoz also improves blood flow through the small blood vessels found in the kidneys, which helps the kidneys to work more efficiently. This in turn can help to slow down the progression of kidney damage that might result from having diabetes or high blood pressure.\nTherefore, there are quite a few reasons why your doctor might have decided to treat you with Ramipril Sandoz. Your doctor may have also prescribed this medicine for another reason.\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about why Ramipril Sandoz has been prescribed for you.\nRamipril Sandoz is not addictive.\nRamipril Sandoz is available only with a doctor’s prescription.\nBefore you take Ramipril Sandoz\nWhen you must not take it\nDo not take Ramipril Sandoz if:\nyou have had an allergy to Ramipril Sandoz or any other medicine containing ramipril , or any of the listed at the end of this leaflet.\nSymptoms of an allergic reaction may include skin rash, itchiness, shortness of breath, swelling of the face, lips or tongue, abdominal pain, muscle pain or tenderness, or joint pain.\nyou have taken any other ‘ACE inhibitor’ medicine before, which caused your face, lips, tongue, throat, hands or feet to swell up, or made it hard for you to breathe.\nIf you have had an allergic reaction to an ACE inhibitor before, you may be allergic to Ramipril Sandoz.\nyou or your family have a history of swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat, intestines, hands or feet, for no apparent reason.\nyou have kidney problems or a condition called ‘renal artery stenosis’.\nyou have problems or conditions affecting the flow of blood in and out of your heart (e.g. aortic or valvular stenosis).\nyou have low blood pressure.\nyou undergo dialysis using certain high-flux membranes.\nyou are pregnant or intend to become pregnant.\nRamipril Sandoz may enter your womb and affect your baby if you take it during pregnancy.\nyou are breastfeeding.\nRamipril Sandoz may pass into the breast milk and affect your breast-fed baby.\nDo not take Ramipril Sandoz after the expiry date printed on the pack or if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.

The usual dose of Ramipril Sandoz is:\nfor high blood pressure, 2.5 mg to 10 mg per day.\nfor heart failure, 5 mg to 10 mg per day.\nfor kidney problems, 1.25 mg to 5 mg per day.\nfor cardiovascular risk, 2.5 mg to 10 mg per day.\nDepending on your response, your doctor may adjust the dose.\nIf two tablets are prescribed, your doctor may want you to take them both together or at different times. This will depend on the condition being treated and how you respond to Ramipril Sandoz.\nFollow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.\nIf you do not understand the instructions on the box, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.\nHow to take it\nRamipril Sandoz should be swallowed whole with plenty of fluid.\nWhen to take it\nTake Ramipril Sandoz at about the same time each day. Taking your tablets or capsules at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take your medicine.\nIt does not matter if you take Ramipril Sandoz before or after food.\nHow long to take it\nRamipril Sandoz helps control your condition, but does not cure it. Therefore you must take Ramipril Sandoz every day. Continue taking your medicine for as long as your doctor tells you.\nIf you forget to take it\nIf it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to.\nOtherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking your medicine as you would normally.\nDo not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed. This may increase the chance of you getting an unwanted side effect.\nIf you are not sure what to do or if you have trouble remembering when to take Ramipril Sandoz, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\nIf you take too much (overdose)\nImmediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (in Australia telephone 13 11 26), or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much Ramipril Sandoz. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. You may need urgent medical attention.\nIf you take too much Ramipril Sandoz, you may feel light-headed, dizzy or you may faint. You may also experience slow heart beat.\nWhile you are taking Ramipril Sandoz\nThings you must do\nTell any other doctors, dentists and pharmacists who are treating you that you are taking Ramipril Sandoz.\nIf you are about to be started on any new medicine, tell your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking Ramipril Sandoz.\nMake sure you drink enough water during exercise and hot weather when you are taking Ramipril Sandoz, especially if you sweat a lot. If you do not drink enough water while taking Ramipril Sandoz, you may feel faint, light-headed or sick. This is because your blood pressure is dropping suddenly. If you continue to feel unwell, tell your doctor.\nIf you have excess vomiting or diarrhoea while taking Ramipril Sandoz, tell your doctor. You may lose too much water and salt and your blood pressure may drop too much.\nIf you feel light-headed or dizzy after taking your first dose of Ramipril Sandoz, or when your dose is increased, tell your doctor immediately.\nIf you plan to have surgery that needs a general anaesthetic, tell your doctor or dentist that you are taking Ramipril Sandoz. Your blood pressure may drop suddenly.\nIf you become pregnant or intend to become pregnant while taking Ramipril Sandoz, tell your doctor immediately.\nIf you are about to have any blood tests, tell your doctor that you are taking Ramipril Sandoz. Ramipril Sandoz may interfere with the results of some tests.\nHave your blood pressure checked when your doctor says, to make sure Ramipril Sandoz is working.\nGo to your doctor regularly for a check-up. Your doctor may occasionally do a blood test to check your potassium levels and see how your kidneys are working.\nThings you must not do\nDo not give Ramipril Sandoz to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.\nDo not take Ramipril Sandoz to treat any other complaints unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you to.\nDo not stop taking Ramipril Sandoz, or lower or increase the dosage, without checking with your doctor.\nThings to be careful of\nIf you feel light-headed, dizzy or faint when getting out of bed or standing up, get up slowly. Standing up slowly, especially when you get up from bed or chairs, will help your body get used to the change in position and blood pressure. If this problem continues or gets worse, talk to your doctor.\nBe careful driving or operating machinery until you know how Ramipril Sandoz affects you. As with other ACE inhibitor medicines, Ramipril Sandoz may cause dizziness, light-headedness, tiredness or drowsiness in some people. Make sure you know how you react to Ramipril Sandoz before you drive a car, operate machinery, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or light-headed. If this occurs do not drive. If you drink alcohol, dizziness or light-headedness may be worse.\nThings that would be helpful for your blood pressure or heart failure\nSome self help measures suggested below may help your condition. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about these measures and for more information.\nAlcohol - your doctor may advise you to limit your alcohol intake.\nDiet - eat a healthy low-fat diet which includes plenty of fresh vegetables, fruit, bread, cereals and fish. Also eat less fat and sugar.\nExercise - regular exercise helps to reduce blood pressure and helps get the heart fitter, but it is important not to overdo it. Walking is good exercise, but try to find a route that is reasonably flat. Before starting any exercise, ask your doctor about the best kind of programme for you.\nSalt - your doctor may advise you to watch the amount of salt in your diet. To reduce your salt intake you should avoid using salt in cooking or at the table.\nSmoking - your doctor may advise you to stop smoking or at least cut down.\nWeight - your doctor may suggest losing some weight to help lower your blood pressure and help lessen the amount of work your heart has to do. Some people may need a dietician’s help to lose weight.\nSide effects\nTell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking Ramipril Sandoz. Ramipril Sandoz helps most people, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people. All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not.

These side effects can also occur without the presence of alcohol.\nAlthough these side effects can occur at the usual recommended doses, the risk of these behaviours occurring may also be increased if you take more than the recommended dose.\nSome sleep medicines may cause short-term memory loss. When this occurs, a person may not remember what has happened for several hours after taking the medicine.

If your sleep problems continue, consult your doctor.\nSome medicines can cause dependence, especially when they are used regularly for longer than a few weeks.

The use of this product in any other species would be considered "off label usage". Products should not be used outside of their registered label claims without first consulting a veterinarian (if at all). Variation in metabolisms between different species mean that dose rates can vary quite widely and that some species may be far more sensitive than others making products dangerous or even potentially fatal to those animals. It is for this reason that "off label dosage" should only be conducted under the supervision of a veterinarian.Can I use Rapigel on myself?\nRapigel® is registered for use in horses and dogs only (refer above response). Virbac is an animal health company, there has been no research conducted for use in humans. We cannot advise use in humans, please check with your GP or specialist before using Rapigel.',' \nMenthol 20mg/gCamphor 6.25mg/gIsopropyl Alcohol 350mg/gStore below 30°C (Room Temperature) in a cool place.\nKeep the lid tightly closed.','36.99','37','30','20','Bednar-Ruecker','0597-0147','7000','976804187-0');

Normally this process localises the problem and results in regeneration or repair of damaged tissue. Unfortunately this process is not always beneficial in some people, and in some circumstances can actually cause further damage and injury.There are many mechanisms in the body involved in the inflammatory response. Lyprinol helps to reduce inflammation by inhibiting the action of enzymes involved in the inflammatory pathway called the LOX pathway. By inhibiting these enzymes Lyprinol® can reduce both inflammation and pain, and yet does not interfere with the more positive aspects of the normal inflammatory response.Lyprinol has a more complex lipid structure compared to other marine oils. This includes the presence of a number of compounds known to be anti-inflammatory, such as omega-3 fatty acids. This complex mixture of lipids is regarded as being essential to explaining the potent action of Lyprinol.',' \nThis product is derived from shellfish.
